# Benz_Time_on_Bench
Using structured data to reduce the time a vehicle spends on the test bench during production

This was an assignment from a class. It makes good use of dimensionality reduction, scaling, encoding, pipelines, and ensemble model predictions. Specifically, here I used XGBoost's Regression model. 
 
I will discuss the problem and my thought processes along the way. I found the business case for this problem interesting. I am a fan of manufacturing and more specifically the theory of constraints.
